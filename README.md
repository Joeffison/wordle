# wordle
Practicing pygame with a very simple game. I also wanted to play wordle more than once a day and decided to implement one myself.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- asdf (recommended)
  - **note:** alternatively you can install poetry and python yourself,
however in that case you have to check pyproject.toml for the appropriate
python version and you must use `poetry install` instead of `make setup`.


1. install all dependencies and create the virtual environment with
    ```sh
    make setup
    ```

**note:** If you are going to run tests and contribute to this project,
please run the command below instead:
```sh
make setup-dev
```


## How to play

1. Make sure you setup the game (one-time step)
2. run the game with:
    ```sh
    make play
    ```


## Contributing

Please reach out to me in case you would like to contribute.
Before you get started, please see [Setup](#setup) for setting up the project.

### testing

1. Run all tests with:
    ```sh
    make test
    ```
